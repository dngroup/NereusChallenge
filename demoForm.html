                    <p align="justify" ><span class="marge"/>You are relying on HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) protocols to stream your videos, such as MPEG-DASH, Apple’s HLS, Microsoft’s Smooth Streaming or Adobe’s HDS ?
                    You are paying a CDN solution to a provider, such as Akamai, Amazon or Limelight that deploys the streaming for you ?</p>

                    <p align="justify" ><span class="marge"/>We propose another solution that would provide better video quality to your costumers and less costs of deployment for you, without additional investments required: MS-Stream.</p>

                    <p align="justify" ><span class="marge"/>Unlike existing solutions that rely on the « one server to one client » approach, MS-Stream takes advantage of multiple content source servers simultaneously, including the ones that are not currently used in the content delivery chain (Set-Top boxes, cheap commodity devices, users' devices, any type of datacenters from cloud providers as well as ISPs, …). The MS-Stream solution decides, in live and dynamically for each segment, the number of servers needed and retrieves from each of them the adequate « description* » of the desired segment. Each « description », created instantaneously and on-demand to fit the related server-client pipe, is unique, independent from each other but aggregatable together in order to enhance the overall quality of the received video. Even if a « description » is lost (e.g. server link problems), the client can still benefit from the « descriptions » retrieved from the other servers in order to recompose and display the video.</p>

                    <p align="justify" ><span class="marge"/>MS-Stream outperforms all HAS solutions in terms of video quality bitrate at client side (better by at least 70%), start-up delay (decreased by min. half), rebuffering events (almost null), quality fluctuations (decreased by min. 2/3).
                    MS-Stream is a pragmatic solution, very lightweight, decoder-standard compliant (H264, H265, …), and fully compatible with MPEG-DASH (the mpd files of both solutions are compatible; MS-Stream using one server is DASH!).</p>

                    <p align="justify" >*A "description" is a specific reduced representation of the original content. The « description » concept proposed here is the heart of our efficient streaming solution MS-Stream. Contact us for additional information on the « description » feature of MS-Stream.</p>
